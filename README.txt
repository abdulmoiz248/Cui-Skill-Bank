This program serves as a registration system for employees and staff members. It allows employees to input the skills they possess and the skills they are seeking to acquire. The staff members are responsible for matching up employees based on their respective skill sets. All the relevant data, including employee skills and matches, is presented to the director. Additionally, the program facilitates community activities and enables users to submit queries, which are addressed by the staff members.
